# Render Build Fix - Summary

## Problem
The bot deployment was failing on Render with the following error:
```
npm error code 1
npm error path /path/to/node_modules/inngest-cli
npm error command failed
npm error command sh -c node postinstall.js
npm error FetchError: request to https://cli.inngest.com/artifact/v1.12.1/inngest_1.12.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz failed
```

The `inngest-cli` package tries to download binaries during its postinstall script, which fails in restricted network environments like Render's build system.

## Solution
Added the `--ignore-scripts` flag to npm install commands in the render configuration files. This prevents postinstall scripts from running while still installing all necessary dependencies.

## Files Modified
1. **render.yaml** (line 13)
   - Before: `buildCommand: npm install --include=dev && npm run build`
   - After: `buildCommand: npm install --include=dev --ignore-scripts && npm run build`

2. **replacements/render.yaml** (line 7)
   - Before: `buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build`
   - After: `buildCommand: npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm run build`

## Verification
The fix has been tested locally with the following results:
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully (877 packages)
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Output generated in `.mastra/output/` directory
- ✅ No errors during build process
- ✅ Start command works correctly

## Impact
- **Scope**: Minimal - only changes build commands in deployment configurations
- **Risk**: Very low - `--ignore-scripts` only skips postinstall scripts, not the actual package installation
- **Breaking Changes**: None - the inngest-cli binary is not required for runtime, only for development CLI commands

## Why This Works
The `inngest-cli` package is used for development commands but is not required for the production build or runtime. The Mastra build process bundles everything needed into the `.mastra/output` directory, and the production server runs from this bundled output.

By skipping the postinstall scripts:
- We avoid the network fetch failure for inngest-cli binaries
- All required dependencies are still installed
- The build process completes successfully
- The production deployment works normally

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Push this fix to your repository
2. Trigger a new build on Render (automatic if auto-deploy is enabled)
3. Monitor the build logs to confirm it completes successfully
4. Test the bot functionality after deployment

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Render build logs for the success message: "Build successful, you can now deploy the .mastra/output directory"
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly in Render dashboard
3. Check the bot logs after deployment for runtime errors
4. Ensure the start command matches: `npm start` (which runs `node .mastra/output/index.mjs`)
